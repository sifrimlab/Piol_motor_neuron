# Resolve image analysis

This folder contains the code to segment the NFH staining performed alongside the Resolve technique, and then partition the count matrix into positive and negative assigned spots.

- Demo is found in `Resolve_NFH_image_analysis_ExtFig7.ipynb`. Run it from a conda environment created from `../yamls/img_processing.yml` .

- For the initial image processing part (Segmentation and mask generation) you'll also have to install [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/) and [FIJI](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/)
